<h3 align="left">Introduction
  <h3 align="left">impact resistance properties of tiles are important property to be identified, for that purpose impact testing instrument was fabricated according to Sri Lanka industry specification and this Impact resistance can be measured by coefficient of restitution ’e’.Futhermore, This The coefficient of restitution calculated by relative velocity of departure divided by the relative velocity of approach </h3>
